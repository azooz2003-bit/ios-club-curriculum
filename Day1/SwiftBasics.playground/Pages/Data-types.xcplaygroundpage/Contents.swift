/* BASIC DATA TYPES: You should know most of these, however note the following:
 
 - Use the explicit type notation as we've done below to make your variables more readable and avoid type errors later on. A lot of benefits to this.
 - Feel free to uncomment the print statements and play with the values of the different variables, in the case that you have any doubts.
 - Note how we label the indicate variable types.

var NIL = nil
 ^ Illegal to assign without an explicit type, however to introduce this simply, think of nil as None in Python or null in Java.
