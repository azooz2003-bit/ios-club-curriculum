// Wondering where the "person, age in" syntax came from? This is just how we retrieve the (String, Int) input passed into the function and use it. Also, calling the input variable "person" from "person, age in" doesn't matter, since it's an anonymous function (a closure), it would act the same if I changed it to "name". Naming the input is simply an act of convenience.
